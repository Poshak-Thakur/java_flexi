1. Why is there no concept of pointer in Java?
Java does not provide pointers like C or C++ because Java was designed to be simple, secure, and robust.
In languages like C/C++, pointers allow direct access to memory addresses. While powerful, they can also cause serious problems such as:
•	Memory corruption
•	Illegal memory access
•	Segmentation faults
•	Security vulnerabilities
Java avoids these issues by using a safer mechanism called references.
Key Reasons Java Doesn’t Support Pointers:
a) Security
Pointers can access any memory location, which may lead to hacking or unauthorized access. Java prevents this by not allowing direct memory manipulation.
b) Simplicity
Pointers make programming more complex. Java removes them to keep the language beginner-friendly and cleaner.
c) Automatic Memory Management
Java uses Garbage Collection, which automatically frees unused memory. With pointers, manual memory management becomes necessary.
d) No Pointer Arithmetic
In C/C++, you can do operations like ptr++, which can easily lead to accessing wrong memory. Java does not allow this, making programs more stable.
So, Java replaces raw pointers with safe object references, making it more reliable and secure
